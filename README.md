# Custom-Arpeggiator
This project is a prototype for a gesture-based MIDI controller using a microcontroller and ultrasonic sensors. The controller can be used to manipulate various parameters of a MIDI instrument, such as pitch, volume, and modulation, using hand gestures.

The ultrasonic sensors are used to detect the distance between the user's hand and the controller, and this distance is used to control the depth of the MIDI instrument's sound. Potentiometers are used to manipulate other parameters, such as modulation and volume, while buttons are used to activate arpeggiator functions.

Inspiration

This project was inspired by the theremin and other hand-controlled instruments. The goal was to create a similar experience using modern technology.
